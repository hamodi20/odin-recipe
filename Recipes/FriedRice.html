        This Uncle Roger fried rice combines chicken flavored rice, a fried egg, and a crazy good stir fry-like sauce for an over-the-top flavor everyone will love. Plus, everything cooks in just one pan, taking under 30 minutes total!

        THE BEST EGG FRIED RICE
        Now, you might be wondering why this egg fried rice recipe is called "Uncle Roger Fried Rice." Well, I came across a viral video of Nigel Ng, also known as Uncle Roger, criticizing a fried rice tutorial video.
        
        Uncle Roger claims to make the best fried rice, so I wanted to recreate it myself, taste it, and of course, share it with you guys. Because let's face it, if this is actually the best fried rice recipe in the world, everyone should know how to make it!

        With that said, the Uncle Roger fried rice recipe consists of a chicken flavored rice, fried egg, and a simple yet flavorful stir fry-like sauce. And, I have to say, spoiler alert, is without a doubt the best egg fried rice you'll ever make!
        
        Plus, it goes with pretty much anything, like this Blackened Shrimp, but it's filled with so much awesomeness that it really makes a great main meal too.
        
        Also, for what it's worth, my favorite part about this egg fried rice is everything cooks together in the same pan! So the cooking process - and clean up - is super quick and easy.
